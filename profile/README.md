[Omnia](https://omniasec.ai) is an AI-powered platform designed to make the internet safer for everyone, from seasoned cybersecurity analysts to everyday users. Born from a shared passion for cybersecurity and a belief in the power of shared knowledge, Omnia serves as both a powerful tool and a vibrant community.

## Our Mission

The internet should be safer for everyone. Omnia is built to bridge the gap between complex security research and accessible, jargon-free information.

## Core Features

At its core, Omnia functions like a robust, adaptive chat interface that can handle a wide array of cybersecurity tasks:

* **Adaptive Intelligence:** Analysts can dive deep into complex malware investigations, while everyday users receive clear, jargon-free answers to their security questions.

* **Tool Integration:** The platform seamlessly integrates tools and assists with research, adapting to whatever level of expertise you bring.

* **Collaboration & Sharing:** Omnia is a collaborative space where users can create, publish, and share advanced resources, including:

  * Advanced prompts and workflows.

  * Custom knowledge bases.

  * Intelligent agents powered by various AI models.

## Our Roots: The Málaga Basement Team (MBT)

Omnia was born at the **University of Málaga (UMA)** in southern Spain, stemming from our team's experience in the postgraduate program in Reverse Engineering and Malware Intelligence.

This intensive, hands-on course was co-directed by our mentor, **Bernardo Quintero** (founder of VirusTotal). We also learned directly from **Víctor Álvarez** (creator of YARA) and other members of the VirusTotal team. This program shaped not only our technical skills but also a core philosophy: cybersecurity gets stronger when knowledge is shared, when it’s treated as a community, not a fortress.

We sometimes joke about being the **"Málaga Basement Team" (MBT)**, because the course where we met, and where Omnia first took shape, was taught in the training room tucked away in the basement of Google Málaga. Humble beginnings, but the right place to start.

The UMA’s commitment is further cemented by the launch of Spain’s first Bachelor’s Degree combining Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence, an ecosystem we are proud to contribute to.


## Join the Movement

We are applying what we've learned, building with purpose, and making a difference from the ground up.

We believe the best way to achieve our mission is together. We welcome security vendors, researchers, and partners to bring their tools, ideas, and knowledge into Omnia. Together we can build something more useful for the community and make the internet a little safer.
